# Extending Evaluations
There is no one prompt optimizer that works for all tasks. Extending evaluations by introducing more tasks will help choosing the right optimizer for the right task. 

[Evaluations](https://github.com/vaibkumr/prompt-optimizer/tree/master/evaluations) directory of our project can be used to run batch evaluation experiments for various optimizers. 

Please consider contributing more evaluations.
