## üöÄQuick Start

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a dependency manager. Check out Poetry's [documentation on how to install it](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) on your system before proceeding.
To install requirements:

```bash
poetry install -E all
```

This will install all requirements for running the package, examples, linting, formatting, tests, and coverage. Note the `-E all` flag will install all optional dependencies necessary for integration testing.

‚ùóNote: If you're running Poetry 1.4.1 and receive a `WheelFileValidationError` for `debugpy` during installation, you can try either downgrading to Poetry 1.4.0 or disabling "modern installation" (`poetry config installer.modern-installation false`) and re-install requirements. See [this `debugpy` issue](https://github.com/microsoft/debugpy/issues/1246) for more details.

Now, you should be able to run the common tasks in the following section.

## ‚úÖCommon Tasks

Type `make` for a list of common tasks.

### Linting

Linting for this project is done via a combination of [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

### Testing

Unit tests cover modular logic that does not require calls to outside APIs.

To run unit tests:

```bash
make test
```

If you add new logic, please add a unit test.

## Documentation

### Contribute Documentation

Docs are largely autogenerated by [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) from the code.

For that reason, we ask that you add good documentation to all classes and methods.


### Build Documentation Locally

Before building the documentation, it is always a good idea to clean the build directory:

```bash
make docs_clean
```

Next, you can run the linkchecker to make sure all links are valid:

```bash
make docs_linkcheck
```

Finally, you can build the documentation as outlined below:

```bash
make docs_build
```
