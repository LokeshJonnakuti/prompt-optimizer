The stomach are connected to the trachea, and more and more layers os smaller and smaller pores are attached from top to bottom, thus sending oxygen to the whole body. At the current level of oxygen content in the atmosphere, the total length of tre stomatal system has reached the limit; zf the total length exceeds this limit, the oxygen supply capacity will be insufficient. Therefore, it can be judged that the amount of oxygen can determine the size of insects.Question: Which of the following, if true, best supports the above argument? A. A.Studies of invertebrates in the ocean have also found that organisms are larger in colder and oxygen-rich water B. B.During the Carboniferous period, the concentration of oxygen in the earth's atmosphere was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%.
