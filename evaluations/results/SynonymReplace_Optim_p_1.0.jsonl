The stoma are connected to the trachea, and more and more layers of small and small centre are attached from top to bottom, thus sending O to the whole body. At the current level of O content in the atmosphere, the total length of the stomatal system has strain the limit; if the total length outperform this limit, the O supply capacity will be insufficient. Therefore, it can be try that the amount of O can learn the size of insects.Question: Which of the followings, if true, best supports the above argument? A. A.Studies of invertebrates in the sea have also found that organisms are heavy in cold and oxygen-rich water B. B.During the carbonic period, the density of O in the earth's aura was as high as 35%, much higher than the current 21%. At that time, many monster worm live on the earth, and the dragonfly wingspan was close to one meter C. C.Small locust cannot outlast in an environment with low O content, especially in an environment with an O density of less than 15%, while adult locust can outlast in an environment with 2% O content D.
